I am a first year PhD candidate at the [Kavli Institute of Cosmology](https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk) within the [Cavdenish Radio Astronomy and Cosmology](https://www.cavendishradiocosmology.com) Group under the supervision of Dr Eloy de Lera Acedo. My research, funded by the [Harding Distinguished Scholars Programme](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk), leverages machine learning and high-performance computing to accelerate statistical inference from the next generation of astronomical surveys.

On the cosmology side, my work focuses on the 21 cm line — a powerful tracer of the evolution of cosmic hydrogen in the high-redshift Universe. As a unique probe of the Cosmic Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and the Epoch of Reionisation, its detection will enable us to infer the earliest stages of large-scale structure formation, including the properties of the first galaxies and the nature of dark matter.

From a data-driven perspective, I am intresting in developing analysis pipelines, novel statistical algorithms, and Bayesian machine learning techniques in preparation for upcoming large-scale surveys — most notably the [Square Kilometer Array Observatory](https://www.skao.int/en), which will generate over 700 PB of data annually. With the overarching goal of designing methods that efficiently solve inverse problems while scaling with data volume, model complexity, and parameter-space dimensionality, my research aims to fully exploit these datasets to revolutionise our understanding of the Universe, with applications extending across astronomy — from broader cosmology to gravitational-wave astrophysics.


Prior to my PhD, I completed the [MPhil Data Intensive Science](https://mphildis.bigdata.cam.ac.uk), a programme jointly taught by the Department of Physics, the Institute of Astronomy, and the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. My research centred on Near-Field Cosmology, where I leveraged unsupervised machine-learning methodologies to study the formation and assembly history of the Milky Way, while also developing data pipelines in preparation for the next generation of chemo-dynamical surveys from WEAVE and 4MOST. Alongside this, I undertook projects in cosmological inference from gravitational-wave detections, LoRA adaptations for transformer architectures, and more. I completed my BSc in Physics at Durham University, where I conducted substantial research projects within the [Centre for Extragalactic Astronomy](https://www.astro.dur.ac.uk/CEA/).

Outside academia, I am passionate about endurance sports. I rowed competitively as part of Durham University’s British Rowing Programme and recently completed the [Great Norse Run](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=b4e332f294b324c3&rls=en&udm=7&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeiAkWG4OlBE2zyCTMjPbGmPgfe_7ak8LUsonpWCvT6w6gBS5y5_2UitN_11b98v-OURPOQUAkPBDEffTFERQVWdJNPAcFXEg5DUAqwfCCslHRYFZ1iZ9rbkTb1DzQ1hmj6Nis3ByXdFBVKArQkDPBZ1Q8rNuYICGGTA5ehXhNrC97pgI8Q&q=Great+norse+run&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4m_Le96qPAxX7WEEAHapCLhcQtKgLegQIFhAB&biw=1694&bih=1058&dpr=2#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:1288cefd,vid:MgN2VOY2nPE,st:0) in Iceland.
